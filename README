This originally started to fulfill my MS Biostatistics comprehensive exam at UC Davis. Posted here for knowledge sharing and archiving. The layout is as follows:

- Literature for the papers that I have probably read about

- plots used for report generation

- Report: The report I have at the time I present the results

- scripts: west_nile_virus.r is the main script, contain CV, various models I tried( RF, logistic, GAM etc). The remaining are sample scripts that inspire some of the ideas.
